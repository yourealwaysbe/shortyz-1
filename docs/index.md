# Online Sources of Puzzles

Many crossword compilers and fans host web pages where puzzles can be
downloaded. Below is a list of sources known to Forkyz. Please [raise an
issue on our GitHub page][issues] if you would like to add a source or
make a correction.

Forkyz will attempt to open any file you give it, but look out for
Across Lite (.puz) or JPZ in particular.

The majority of the links on this page come from [Michael F. Gill
(Mokelfish)'s list of puzzles][monkelfish].
